## Blog Summaries  

### 1. **Understanding CI/CD**  
The blog explores the concepts of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD), highlighting their role in automating the software development lifecycle. CI focuses on frequently merging code changes into a shared repository, running automated tests to catch issues early, and maintaining code quality. CD ensures code changes are prepared for deployment or pushed directly to production without manual intervention. Tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and Prometheus are discussed, alongside the benefits of CI/CD, such as faster releases, enhanced code quality, and automation. The blog also addresses challenges like team communication and tool integration, offering insights into optimizing development workflows.  

### 2. **Setting Up an EKS Cluster Using Pulumi**  
This blog provides a step-by-step guide to setting up an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster using Pulumi, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) platform. Pulumi enables developers to use familiar programming languages to define and manage cloud infrastructure. The blog walks through installing the Pulumi CLI, logging in, installing required plugins (AWS and EKS), creating a project, and defining the EKS cluster in Python. Finally, it details how to deploy the cluster and export the kubeconfig. By simplifying the process with Pulumi, the blog demonstrates how to streamline the setup of scalable Kubernetes clusters in AWS.
